## Professional Experience
## Software Project Management & Agile Process Optimization

In 2021, I was hired as a Project Manager to oversee and coordinate efforts between a local software development team in Venezuela and an international team based in India, both supporting the source code of a Houston-based B2B eCommerce and EDI procurement automation company.

Due to the complexity and scale of the Houston based company’s core business systems, my role focused on:

- Monitoring and managing issue tracking using Atlassian Jira, while promoting SCRUM-based development practices.
- Conducting a 6-month analysis phase to evaluate team workflows and propose a comprehensive system revamp strategy.
- Working with decision-makers to address chronic issues with inaccurate delivery estimates and misaligned development priorities. A strategic review of business goals and development resource allocation was required to optimize investment and output.

After a year, I successfully delivered Atlassian Jira Advanced Roadmap planning solution, which included:

Cross-functional dependency tracking

Capacity allocation modeling

    Simulation-based planning scenarios

These solutions significantly improved the organization’s ability to prioritize features, allocate development resources effectively, and produce more accurate software delivery estimates.
